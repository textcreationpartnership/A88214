            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HAving for ſome certain weeks by paſt, been out of the
City in the North, at my coming home, I met with a
reproachful caluminons pamphlet, without any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours

mouth of Iniquity ſtopped,</hi> Printed by <hi>John Meacock</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> and
inquiring as diligently after the Authour of it, as poſibly I can; I
am confidently informed, that it came to the Preſſe in your handwriting, &amp; that your ſelf in perſon were at the <hi>Printing houſe,</hi> to look
after the correcting of it, and that you are the Authour of it: And
finding my ſelf and ſome of my night relations, ſomewhat d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it may be, have ſome thoughts, to deale with it as it deſerves: but
leaſt any reflexion upon ſlender grounds ſhould be upon you; I
judged it but the part of a man, that hath but either a gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

it for granted it is yours; and further if you own it, to avoid any
further paper jangling, I ſhall if you pleaſe, give you a meeting
face to face, with a few friends of yours and mine; where I doubt
not but in every circumſtance fully to clear up unto you, that my
Father Mr. <hi>Richard Lilburn,</hi> and my Uncle Mr. <hi>George Lilburn,</hi>
have been as faithful Servants, hearty, as zealous, and as honeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and the true intereſt of the Nation
of <hi>England,</hi> both before the warrs in the Kings prerogative time,
and from the firſt day of the late warres, to this very hour, as any
two Committeemen imployed by the Parl. in any County what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
in the whole Nation of <hi>England;</hi> &amp; never did, either jointly
or dividedly in the whole progreſs of their Committee actions,
or any other actions, any one ſingle act, that in the ſtricteſt
ſenſe comes within the compaſs of the Ordinance of ſequeſtration;
and that they both have been great loſers, and not in the leaſt
gainers by the warres and troubles of the Nation; and that they
have neither jointly nor dividedly done any one action in all their
publick imployments, or by any colour thereof, that juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to have them, or either of them branded, as cozeners and
cheaters of the State of great ſums of money, as Sir <hi>Arthur Hazle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi>
hath taxed them, or the one of them to be in the Speakers
Chamber of late, before divers Members there: and alſo at
<hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall,</hi> openly and ſeveral times; and although moſt
unjuſtly he hath ſequeſtred the one of them, and endeavoured the
deſtruction of them both, and their whole poſterity; and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſtrongly endeavoured to root them out, for having a name or
being in the County, where they have received their firſt breath,
and have had their moſt conſtant abode: And that Sir <hi>Arthur</hi>
himſelf is the man of all them three, guiltieſt of every particular
thing he chargeth upon them. All which (if you decline a fair and
friendly meeting, as is before deſired) I give you hereby authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to acquaint Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> that if he pleaſe to procure an Order
from the Parliament, I will meet him at the open barre of their
Houſe, upon equal, fair and juſt tearmes; and in the behalf of my
Father and Unckle <hi>George,</hi> or either of them, I will meet him face
to face, and will hazard my life and eſtate, as far as by Law any
pretended crimes againſt them are capable of puniſhment, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and make good by credible witneſſes, appearing <hi>vivâ voce</hi> at the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117928:2"/>
barre of the Parliament, at the intire charges of him or them, that
they ſhall judge the offender and guilty party: provided his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and eſtate may be declared to be as liable to repair wrongs
done to the State and us, (I mean the parties aforeſaid) as ours
may be to repair wrongs done to the State or him: and I think this
is fair and honeſt, eſpecially conſidering he hath ten times my
intereſt in the Parliament. And that you may a little know, I ſpeak
not at random; I muſt let you know, I loſt divers hundreds of
pounds about 3. years agoe, that in probability I might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
had not the malice of a North Countrey Parliament man
been, who made uſe of a charge of delinquency, then prefered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my Unckle, to be revenged of me his Nephew, to my loſſe
and detriment of about 5 or 600 l. that I might juſtly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have poſſeſſed; of which being acquainted, by my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and never to be forgotten friend Col. <hi>Rigby,</hi> I haſtned down to
the Countrey, and told my Uncle of it, and all the circumſtances
of it; and further proteſted to him, his crimes ſhould not be my
ruine; and therefore if he would not endeavour to bring his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to a final tryal, that thereby he might be cleared, I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
proſecutor in the States behalf, to bring him to his deſerts;
but if he knew himſelf clear, and would endeavour his juſtification
by a final Tryal, I would venter my life and eſtate with him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Agent to mannage his buſineſs for him: upon which I
digged into the very bottom of all he was charged with, and came
to the Committee of <hi>Durham,</hi> and before Sir <hi>Arthur;</hi> and the then
Committee, opened his caſe, and preſſed for a ſet day of hearing;
which Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> and the Committee granted, and cauſed the
Order to be ſent to <hi>Shadford,</hi> his proſecutor, a Delinquent in both
the firſt and ſecond warre, or one of them, (I do aver it at my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
ingaging to make it good: now Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> High Sherief of the
County of <hi>Durham,</hi> whoſe heart failing him, and his Conſcience
telling him my Unckle was an honeſt man, and free from all his
falſe accuſations; for he pretended my Unckles power was ſo
great in that Countrey, his witneſſes durſt not ſpeak the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my Unckle; whereupon with my Unckles conſent, I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that ſeeing the Gentleman had a Brother ſitting in Parliament
<hi>(viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>John Blaxſton)</hi> and my Unckle had none, that therefore in
regard he might not doubt of fair play, I deſired all things betwixt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117928:3"/>
them, by that Committe might be tranſmitted to Parliament, which
the Committee with Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> unanimouſly ordered; but after
the Order was drawn by <hi>Iſaac Gilpin</hi> their Clark then ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, according to all their deſires, and openly read: the
proſecutor <hi>Shadford</hi> whiſpered Sir <hi>Arthur;</hi> upon which he took the
Order, and turned him to the window, and of his own accord
blotted out all thoſe lines and words that ordered the tranſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and in their ſteads with his own hand interlined ſo
many lines and words, as made the Order to amount
to thus much in effect, That if <hi>George Lilburn</hi> would forgive <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Shadford, Tho Shadford</hi> ſhould forgive <hi>George Lilburn,</hi> and
proſecute him no further; of which I cryed ſhame, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> was over-ruled by the Committee, and the caſe
tranſmitted to the Houſe of Commons, where by reaſon of Mr.
<hi>Blaxſtones</hi> greatneſs, my Unckles Petition could not procure a
hearing, till he was fain to print a Remonſtrance againſt Mr. <hi>Blax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi>
and <hi>Shadford &amp;c.</hi> and delivered it at the Houſe door; upon
which it was eferred to the Northern Committee, where Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi>
got the Chair in the Speakers Chamber; where were preſent
ſometimes 12. 16. and more Members of the then Houſe of
Commons; and Major <hi>John Wildman</hi> and my ſelf being my Unckles
Councel to mannage his buſineſs for him: in the opening of my
Unckles cauſe, I paid Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> and his unwarrantable dealing in
his carriage a <hi>Durham</hi> to the full, to his face, before the whole
Committee; and Mr. <hi>Blaxſtone</hi> had ſo much of it there, that I have
heard it credibly ſaid, with very grief he went home diſcontented,
that he could not have his will of my Unckle; and after that, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſtirred out of his Chamber, till he was carried to his grave:
and my Unckle in the concluſion, by that very Committee, was
honourably acquitted, and commanded to go home; ſome of them
promiſing him to take care of his report to the Houſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not yet made, Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> and his Agents the laſt year, (pending
the ſaid report, to the high diſhonour of the Parliament,) ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
him for thoſe very things then charged upon him out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
that his Son <hi>Thomas Lilburn</hi> had ſo much honeſty, as to be
the Countries Agent to complain above a year agoe to General
<hi>Fairfax, &amp;c.</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> of either Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> or ſome of his
Officers, detaining from the Souldiers, great ſtore of their billet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117928:3"/>
money; for want of which they were connived at to take free
billet of the Countrey, contrary to an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And now Sir, upon the forementioned Ingagement to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle,
I have lately and ſeriouſly and deliberately digged into the
bottom of my Unckles buſineſs, that now he is by Sir <hi>Arthur</hi>
troubled, and indeavoured to be deſtroyed for; and upon my
Conſcience and life as in the ſight of God, I ſpeak it, I judge them
al ſo juſt and honeſt, as that I judge my ſelf bound in duty before
God and man, to diſcharge my foreſaid Engagement to him, and
to venture my life and eſtate for his juſt preſervation, and if I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,

have loſt a peece of one of my fingers, then thus publickly to have
ſpoken; but when I ſeriouſly conſider that ſtory that I have often
heard, <hi>That the laying of the knite to the Fathers throat, cauſed the
dumb Child in a miraculous way to ſtrain it ſelf, and to cry out for help
to ſave its likely to be deſtroyed Father</hi> I am provoked and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to ſay to my ſelf; and ſhall I (though lately reſolved in my ſelf,
by never ſo much printing ſilence) hold my peace, when as I viſibly
and apparently ſee (at leaſt to my underſtanding) not only the
knife as it were laid to the throat of my Father, but even to the
very eſſence and being of his Family, (and that for no other crime
appearing to me, but only becauſe they dare be <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> to
ſtand to maintain their own rights, and will not be Sir <hi>Arthur
Haſlerigs</hi> Vaſſals and ſlaves, to do what ever he pleaſeth?) O God
forbid that I ſhould live to that day, to be guilty of that groſſe
baſeneſs; and therefore have I throne fear aſide, once again to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the world; yet with this reſolution, to ſpread before my
eyes in my writing, both thoſe Acts of Parliament about treaſon,
of the 14. of <hi>May,</hi> and the 17. of <hi>July</hi> 1649. upon which at my
late Tryal at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> I was arraigned, and which is printed in the
86. 87. 88. 89. &amp; 90. pages of that Book, called Lieut. Col. <hi>John
Lilburns</hi> Trial; with the conſtant looking upon which, I hope my
pen will be kept from any pretended ſlip, failings, or diſtaſte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>
                  <hi>IMprimis,</hi> two Warrants were produced, directed to the chief
Conſtables of the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and dated at <hi>Newcaſtle
Septemb.</hi> 12. 1642. Commanding them to furniſh the Earl of
<hi>Newcaſtle</hi> with Horſes, to carry Ammunition for the Kings ſervice;
and unto theſe was ſubſcribed <hi>George Lilburn,</hi> and a ſeal was ſet to
them by the name, as the Seal of <hi>George Lilburn.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>George Lilburn</hi> being examined, and asked whether the name
of <hi>George Lilburn</hi> ſubſcribed to thoſe warrants produced, and the
Seal ſet to them as his, were his Hand and Seal; he anſwered that
he knew not that it was his Hand and Seal, ſaying his Hand and
Seal had been divers times counterfeited, as he could prove.</p>
               <p>For proof that the Warrants were ſigned and ſealed by <hi>George
Lilburn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Martin Foſter</hi> was examined as a witneſs, who ſaith,

<q>That he was a Captain in the Kings ſervice, under the Earl of

                     <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and that he ſaw (as he thinketh) about ſix years ſince,
about the latter end of <hi>November,</hi> a Warrant for promoting the
Kings ſervice, ſigned <hi>George Lilburn;</hi> but whether it were his
hand or his Seal, he knoweth not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Foſter further</hi> ſaith, 
<q>That he knew one <hi>Chilton</hi> was in Col.
<hi>Hiltons</hi> Regiment, under the E. of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> &amp; that he came into
the Regiment before they marched out of the Biſhopr. of <hi>Durham,</hi>
which was after the Battel at <hi>Yareham,</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi>
as he takes it, about <hi>Febr.</hi> 1642. And that he believes that the ſaid
<hi>Chilton</hi> ſerved for Mr. <hi>George Lilburn,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chilton</hi> made
an anſwer for <hi>George Lilburn,</hi> when the liſt of the names
of thoſe which were charged with Arms in that County, was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Mr. <hi>Shadforth</hi> being the proſecutor, examined for information,

<q>that he ſaw not <hi>George Lilburn</hi> ſign or
ſeal the Warrants produced, dated the 12. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1642. but
ſaith, that <hi>George Lilburn</hi> did acknowledge voluntarily in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of <hi>Francis Wren,</hi> and others of the Committee of ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at <hi>Durham,</hi> who were then ſitting as a Committee, that he
did ſign and ſeal the aforeſaid Warrants; ſaying, that when he
ſigned them, he would have ſigned 20. more of the like nature, if

time the ſaid <hi>George Lilburn</hi> came to the ſaid Town-houſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Command or not, he knoweth not; but being come, he
was thruſt back by the ſhoulders, diſreſpectively, and the Kings
Souldiers being at that time within 20. yards of the place, where
Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> was thus uſed: the ſaid <hi>Rob. Sharp</hi> was afraid that
they would keep Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> priſoner, and alſo apprehend him, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117928:6"/>
ſo he fled out of Town; for that he knew Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> was well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

would force him againſt his Conſcience to ſign a Warrant, and

that he had ſhould be loſt; and the ſaid <hi>Carre</hi> heard at that time,
Sir <hi>Tho. Riddles</hi> man told the ſaid <hi>George Lilburn,</hi> that his Maſter
required him to come to him.</q>

when the E of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was raiſing forces againſt the Parliament;
and that the ſaid <hi>George Lilburn</hi> was then very ſolicitous to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thoſe forces, ſaying, he would rather die in a halter, then joyn
with thoſe forces againſt the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Lever</hi> ſaith,
that they then reſolved that <hi>George Lilburn</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Scotland</hi>
for help for the well-affected.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Robert Carr, Mr. George Gray, and Mr. Hen. Lever ſay,

               <p>Mr. Robert Sharp, Mr. Rob. Carr, Mr. Henry Lever, Mr. Gilbert
Marſhall, and Thomas Chilton ſay,
<q>That George Lilburn was about the 11. of November 1642. for his
affection to the Parliament, taken priſoner by one of the Earl of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtles
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117928:6"/>
Colonels, and was barbarouſly uſed, forced to go on foot, pinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the dirt, after the Carriages from <hi>Durham</hi> to <hi>York</hi> Gate-houſe, having
neither fire nor bed, meat nor drink, for 3. dayes and 3. nights, and
that the ſaid George Lilburn was afterwards removed and impriſoned
for above 6 moneths in <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle, where he was ſometimes in the
Dungeon, ſometimes in the common Goale. And <hi>Martin Foſter</hi> ſaith,
he ſaw the ſaid <hi>George Lilburn</hi> Priſoner in <hi>York,</hi> in the Kings forces
in Auguſt 1643.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. John Smart, and Mr. Robert Sharp, examined ſay,
<q>That in their hearing the ſaid <hi>George Lilburn</hi> during his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
was very often above ten times ſolicited by Mr. <hi>Raphe
Hambleton,</hi> to give any ſmall matter to the aſſiſtance of the E. of
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> either a Horſe or the like, and his inlargement ſhould
be procured; but the ſaid <hi>George Lilburn</hi> refuſed alwayes, ſaying,

               </p>

reſolution and ability ſufficient to anſwer for himſelf; and by
what I have heard from him, will rationally and fully do it in
his own time; only as it may be, you may wonder at me for that:
ſo give me leave to wonder at Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> that he
hath lien ſtill all this while, and never indeavoured to take
his remedy at Law againſt Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> for writing his
Book againſt him; ſeeing Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> hath an expreſs Order
from the Honourable the Councel of State, to inable him ſo to
do; for truly I and many others can render no reaſon for Sir
<hi>Arthurs</hi> ſilence in that particular, unleſs it be the guilt of
Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> own Conſcience, which tell him <hi>Muſgrave</hi>
will, if queſtioned, juſtifie and fully prove all or the

in my very heart, he will very fully be able to do: for

in the World more, then to come to a legal tryal, or teſte.
